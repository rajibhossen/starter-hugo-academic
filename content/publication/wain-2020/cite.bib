abstract = {Offloading resource-hungry tasks from mobile devices to an edge server has been explored recently to improve task com- pletion time as well as save battery energy. The low la- tency computing resource from edge servers are a perfect companion to realize such task offloading. However, edge servers may su er from unreliable performance due to its rapid workload variation and reliance on intermittent re- newable energy. Further, batteries in mobile devices make online optimum offloading decisions challenging since it in- tertwines offloading decisions across di erent tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep Q-learning based task offloading solution, DeepTO, for online task offloading. DeepTO learns edge server performance in a model-free manner and takes future battery needs of the mobile device into account. Us- ing a simulation-based evaluation, we show that DeepTO can perform close to the optimum solution that has com- plete future knowledge.},
