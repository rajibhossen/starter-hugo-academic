abstract = {Cloud applications are increasingly moving away from monolithic
services to agile microservices-based deployments. However, effi-
cient resource management for microservices poses a significant
hurdle due to the sheer number of loosely coupled and interacting
components. The interdependencies between various microservices
make existing cloud resource autoscaling techniques ineffective.
Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) based approaches that try to cap-
ture the complex relationships in microservices require extensive
training data and cause intentional SLO violations. Moreover, these
ML-heavy approaches are slow in adapting to dynamically chang-
ing microservice operating environments. In this paper, we propose
PEMA (Practical Efficient Microservice Autoscaling), a lightweight
microservice resource manager that finds efficient resource alloca-
tion through opportunistic resource reduction. PEMAâ€™s lightweight
design enables novel workload-aware and adaptive resource man-
agement. Using three prototype microservice implementations, we
show that PEMA can find efficient resource allocation and save up
to 33% resource compared to the commercial rule-based resource
allocations},
