I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Arlington. 
My PhD supervisor is Dr. Mohammad Atiqul Islam. My primary research interests include Microservices, resource scaling, mobile edge computing, and Machine Learning. My recent research focuses are on finding efficient resources for microservices, building, and 
managing of large-scale microservice deployments, and applying machine learning in systems.

Before joining the PhD program, I worked for 3 years as a software engineer where I gather practical experiences on 
cloud computing, software engineer, and machine learning.
I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering  from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh.
