title: Kubernetes Scaler for High Performance Computing
summary: We developed this tool to automate the deployment of kubernetes cluster in AWS. We also added the support of adding cluster autoscaling mechanism. Moreover, the tool can be used to deploy HPC frameworks such as Flux Operator in the kubernetes. The ultimate goal of the project is to enable autoscaling in the HPC Applications when running into cloud such as AWS and GKE. We've used Python, AWS API, AWS SDK
